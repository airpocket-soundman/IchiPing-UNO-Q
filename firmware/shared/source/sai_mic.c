/*
 * INMP441 SAI RX driver — see sai_mic.h.
 *
 * This is a skeleton that captures the MCUXpresso fsl_sai driver pattern.
 * Concrete register-level numbers (clock divider, slot length, sync mode)
 * must be verified against your SDK version and the FRDM-MCXN947 SAI mux.
 *
 * The INMP441 produces:
 *   - 24-bit signed sample left-justified in a 32-bit I²S slot
 *   - Stereo bus, but L/R pin to GND selects the left channel only
 *   - Standard Philips I²S framing
 *
 * Drop the 8 LSBs and the top 8 sign bits to land in int16 range (i.e.
 * shift the 32-bit slot right by 8 then truncate to int16).
