/*
 * LU9685 (LU9685-20CU) — 20-channel servo controller, I²C variant.
 *
 * Protocol (reverse-engineered from ESPEasy P178 source):
 *   I²C address       : 7-bit, hardware-configurable in 0x00..0x1F via the
 *                       on-board A0..A4 jumpers / solder pads. Stock modules
 *                       observed in this project shipped at 0x1F (all jumpers
 *                       in their default position) — confirm with an I²C bus
 *                       scan on first bring-up. The chip also opts in to the
 *                       I²C General Call address (0x00), so a probe to 0x00
 *                       will *ACK* even though servo commands sent there are
 *                       interpreted as broadcasts and produce no PWM. Use the
 *                       chip's own address, not 0x00.
 *   Channel count     : 20 (vs 16 on the PCA9685)
 *   Reg 0xFC, 16-bit  : PWM frequency in Hz (big-endian, 20..300)
 *   Reg 0xFD, 20 bytes: bulk write all channel angles in one transaction
 *   Reg = pin (0..19) : write 1 byte = angle 0..180 (or 0xFF to disable)
 *
 * The LU9685 maps the angle byte (0..180°) to a 0.5–2.5 ms pulse internally,
 * so no per-servo MIN/MAX tick calibration is required on the host side —
 * one of the few practical wins it has over the PCA9685.
 *
 * IchiPing only uses the first 5 channels (window a/b/c, door AB, door BC);
 * the remaining 15 are left disabled in bulk-write mode.
